This is an original fantasy visual novel I am creating with Ren'Py, inspired by games like I Was a Teenage Exocolonist and Stardew Valley.

Synopsis: Your aunt has asked you to housesit for her in the college town of Dowsing. As soon as you arrive, you learn magic is real--but something is tainting the magic of this place...

Roadmap:
> Create character objects.
> Start list of needed art assets, to be updated as story progresses.
> Add time-tracking system that will trigger main story ending.
> Make minimum playable game with one dialogue option in each tree, leading to one main story ending.
> Add branching dialogue options and multiple main story endings.
> Implement NPC dispositions: (a) tracking, (b) modification with choice selections, and (c) different NPC dialogue based on disposition.
> Add player skills: (a) tracking, (b) modification with choice selections, and (c) different options and/or success rates based on skill levels.
> Add player character option to select observable traits at beginning of game.
> Implement "first impression" system (NPC initial dispositions set based on player character's observable traits).
> Create map/location select system so player can choose what to do at each tick on the time-tracking system.
> Add NPC questlines. Start with minimum playable, then branching.
> Add miscellaneous interactions, particularly with an eye to affecting NPC disposition and player skills.
> Create art assets.
